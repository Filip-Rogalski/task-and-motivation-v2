# Task Manager and Motivation Board

It's an app for motivating workers. The boss ('admin') assigns tasks to his/her workers. Completion of each task is awarded with points.

The App is written in ReactJS, developped with webpack.

(It is my final project for a front-end bootcamp.)

## Installation

Clone or download the project repository. [...]

If you're logged in as a worker ('user'), you can see the overall motivation board of all other workers:

And you can manage your own tasks (mark their completion or cancel):

If you're logged in as admin, in the overall motivation board you have the possibility of assining tasks to your workers:

And you can also manage the general task bank (add new tasks):
